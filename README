gulp-webapp-starter
===================

This is a starter project that I use for creating a front end application using gulp as my tooling
system with a basic front-end asset pipeline.

To build:

1) npm install
2) bower install
3) gulp build -- Leaves files in public/

To debug:

gulp connect

To build:

gulp build-dist -- Leaves files in dist/
